            <span>Why is It Necessary to Keep Eye Siesta Running in the Background?</span>

            <p>
              Due to system limitations, only with the app running in the background can we accurately track your mobile usage. Eye Siesta is incredibly energy-efficient, consuming only 1% to 3% of your battery daily.

            <p>
              Normally,  the app will continue to operate in the background without any additional action required. However, events like system updates or phone reboots will interrupt this background operation; simply relaunch the app to resume.

            <span>What is Strict Mode?</span>

          <div class="a">
            <p>
              When Strict Mode is activated, mini and long breaks become mandatory and cannot be skipped. Additionally, Eye Siesta will automatically restrict the use of all apps, helping you focus solely on resting your eyes and mind.

              Eye Siesta recommends avoiding a whitelist in Strict Mode, as few things are so urgent they can't wait 20 seconds. Nonetheless, Eye Siesta provides the option to set a whitelist, allowing you to customize allowed apps in "Settings â†’ App Whitelist." Please note that this feature is only available to VIP users.

          <div class="a">
            <p>With a VIP membership, you'll enjoy the following advanced features:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Scheduled Activation:</strong> You can schedule time periods for Eye Siesta to be active, such as only during off-work hours. However, we suggest keeping it on at all times for continuous eye protection.</li>
              <li><strong>Automatic Pause:</strong> Eye Siesta will automatically pause the eye usage timer when the screen is locked and resume it upon unlocking. This feature ensures a more precise calculation of eye usage and rest times.</li>
              <li><strong>Reset Threshold:</strong> If the screen lock duration exceeds a certain threshold, the eye usage time will automatically reset. Designed for more accurate tracking, this feature guarantees the most efficient relaxation.</li>
              <li><strong>App Whitelist:</strong> You can designate which apps are available for use in Strict Mode. However, Eye Siesta advises against setting a whitelist in Strict Mode, as few matters are so urgent they cannot be postponed for a brief 20-second break.</li>
